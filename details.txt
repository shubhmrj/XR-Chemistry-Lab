In the 21st century, the learning process does not occur only in the classroom and is based on textbooks. One change that can be identified in this century is that the learning process becomes more interactive and productive with the use of technology tools in education. Before, the learning process was just reading, writing, and counting, but now it involves ICT skills with digital-based teaching aids.
Among the challenges in the 2020 vision that our Prime Minister Shree Narendra Damodardas Modi has pointed out is "Digital India, technology as a means to empower and as a tool that bridges a society that contributes to future scientific and technological civilization." To achieve this endeavor India has introduced various science and technology courses at all levels of education to attract students to grasp it.
The old lab facilities, small space, and inadequate safety lab equipment always threaten the safety of students and teachers. With the help of AR technology, these safety problems can be eliminated by visualizing the apparatus, chemical substance, and chemical reaction in virtual form such as the corrosive, explosion, flaming, and others. Besides, AR can also virtually speed up the chemical reaction so that the students do not have to spend their time waiting for the chemical reaction to complete. Furthermore, the repeatable ability in a virtual environment allows students to keep repeating the experiment to help them understand the concept of the experiment and reduce the cost.
It encourages the students to actively discover knowledge via the application and learn by themselves. This study was an initial step in discovering the possibility of interactive AR in chemistry experiment topics.
The application consists of three primary sections: the alphabet letter section, the alphabet letter with formation section, and the training section. The first section displayed the letter with a sound, and the second section displayed a sign, letters, and simple words. The last section displayed a simple quiz to test the student’s understanding. The pre-test and post-test were done to measure the usability of this application. There were a total of twenty-eight respondents including teachers and students that took part in the testing process. Based on the usability questionnaire result, showed positive feedback from the respondents and proved that the application had the potential as a tool to help students learn the English language.


1.2 Innovation
The AR-based Chemistry Learning System allows students to:
